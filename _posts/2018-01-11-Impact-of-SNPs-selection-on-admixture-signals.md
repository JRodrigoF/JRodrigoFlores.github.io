While SNP ascertainment bias is a well known issue in SNP array-based studies [1,2,3], I have not been able to find a published study or discussion in the Internet about the impact that SNP selection bias can have on amixture analysis using the software admixture [4].

Here I explore this topic by 1) genotyping 150 high-coverage samples from Africa, Europe and East Asia (see [Polaris Diversity Panel](https://jrodrigoflores.com/posts/2018/11/Polaris-project-diversity-panel)), 2) sub-setting the snps to a) all snps found, b) snps in highly reliable and accessible regions of the human genome, c) snps present in the [Illumina Infinium OmniExpress array](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/microarray-kits/infinium-omni-express.html), and d) snps present in the Human Origins array.
