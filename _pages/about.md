I work as a bioinformatician at the [Human Evolutionary Department](http://www.ebc.ee/) at the Genomics Institute of Tartu University in Estonia. I work under the supervision of Dr. Luca Pagani and also collaborate with other colleagues at the department and have a few projects of my own. Topics related to my projects include data integration across different sequencing platforms (Illumina, PacBio, Nanopore, Complete Genomics), development and maintenance of sequence data pipelines (from raw data -> to vcf -> to pop-gen analyses), Y chromosome phylogeography of human populations, and diversity, heterozygosity and admixture patterns across the human autosomes and the X chromosome (See [Projects](https://jrodrigoflores.com/projects/)).    

I did an [undergraduate](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about) program in genomic sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. During this period I did an internship at the Sanger Institute under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Tyler-Smith](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/tyler-smith-chris), where I worked on the topics of human Y chromosome structure and dynamcs, and NGS-based methodologies to analyze structural variation (See [Publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500966/)).

I did a master in Life Sciences and Bioinformatics at Lausanne University in Switzerland. I worked in the laboratory of [Dr. Marc Robinson-Rechavi](https://www.unil.ch/dee/robinson-rechavi-group) under the supervision of Dr. Julien Roux. I worked on the topic of gene expression evolution based on rna-seq data from _Drosophila_ species (See [Thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/imrnpn8ukzkvaar/E%20-%20Master%20Report%20-%20Second%20submission.pdf?dl=0)).
