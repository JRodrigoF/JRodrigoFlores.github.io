Hi. I am a genomicist and bioinformatician doing original research in evolutionary anthropology and human population genetics. I am searching for a PhD position in these areas. I remain broad in my research interests within these and connected areas.

I work in the [Human Evolutionary Department](http://www.ebc.ee/) at the Genomics Institute of Tartu University in Estonia. I work under the supervision of Dr. Luca Pagani and also collaborate with other colleagues at the department and have a few [projects of my own](https://jrodrigoflores.com/projects/). I think these projects span the categories of [feasible](https://jrodrigoflores.com/projects/Genomic-impact-of-the-Black-Death-in-Europe/), [interesting](https://jrodrigoflores.com/projects/Context-dependant-mutation-rates-free-of-recombination/), and [useful](https://jrodrigoflores.com/projects/Automated-identification-of-Y-haplogroups-from-ancient-dna/). I advance them in my free time. 

Topics related to my work include data integration across different sequencing platforms (Illumina, PacBio, Nanopore, Complete Genomics), development and maintenance of sequence data pipelines (from raw data -> to vcf -> to pop-gen analyses), Y chromosome phylogeography of human populations, and diversity, heterozygosity and admixture patterns across the human autosomes and the X chromosome).    

I did an [undergraduate](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about) program in genomic sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. During this period I did an internship at the Sanger Institute under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Tyler-Smith](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/tyler-smith-chris), where I worked on the topics of human Y chromosome structure and dynamcs, and NGS-based methodologies to analyze structural variation (See the paper [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500966/) or [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278788994_Structural_variation_on_the_human_Y_chromosome_from_population-scale_resequencing) and my personal highlights [here](https://jrodrigoflores.com/posts/2018/11/Paper-Y-chromosome-structural-variation/)).

I worked in the laboratory of [Dr. Marc Robinson-Rechavi](https://www.unil.ch/dee/robinson-rechavi-group) under the supervision of Dr. Julien Roux during part of my master studies in Life Sciences and Bioinformatics at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. I worked on the topic of gene expression evolution based on rna-seq data from _Drosophila_ species (See the report [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/imrnpn8ukzkvaar/E%20-%20Master%20Report%20-%20Second%20submission.pdf?dl=0) and my personal highlights [here](https://jrodrigoflores.com/posts/2018/11/Report-Gene-expression-evolution-Drosophila/)).
