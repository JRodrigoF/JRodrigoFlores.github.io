title: 'Detecting the magnitude of the Black Death in Eurasia. What do the genomes tell?'

Archaeologists and historians estimate that between 30% and 50% of the European population died during the 13th-14th centuries due to yet another wave of highly infectious _Yersinia pestis_. Whether it was caused by the same strain that was already present around from previous spreads from Asia to Europe, or this was a new and perhaps even more deadly strain is still matter of debate. Importantly however, the question remains to be answered: What do modern genomes tell us about it? Was it in the magnitude estimated by archaeologists? Do the estimates by region also correlate with genomic evidence?

The plan is to use a panel of Eurasian individuals sequenced at high-coverage and spanning from Spain to the Urals and apply methodologies that recover fluctuation in population size in the recent past, such as IBDNe.
