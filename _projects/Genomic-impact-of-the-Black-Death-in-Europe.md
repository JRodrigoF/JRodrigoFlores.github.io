An important fraction of the medieval population in Europe died during the mid-14th century in a period of less than ten years (1346-1353 AD) due to the second largest spread of Yersinia pestis in human history, an episode also known as the Black Death [1]. Estimates based on archaeology and historical documents range between 25% to 50% of the population being decimated, with important differences among different cities and regions [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463904702771). An important question that remains to be properly addressed is the extent to which genetic evidence agrees and supports one or another of these estimates. Do we observe a magnitude of events corresponding to ~25% or ~50% human loss? Are we able to capture differences by region and do these also correspond to previous evidence from other disciplines?

I am using a panel of Eurasian individuals geographically spanning from Spain to the Urals and further east to China. I will apply then methodologies that recover fluctuations in population size during the recent past, such as IBDne [3](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(15)00288-8).
