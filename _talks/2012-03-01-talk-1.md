Seminar: Evolutionary biology in a gender-neutral world.

Description: 

"In science the sex of the test subject is a common trait that is very often used in analyzing and interpreting the results. From a science outreach perspective, sex differences found in scientific studies are extra appealing, due to ease of understanding and intriguing (click-bait) nature of reporting this kind of results. Suboptimal communication of results showing existence or, alternatively, lack of sex differences may lead to various misinterpretations. We need a better understanding of conscious and unconscious sex-related biases in order to effectively, but also sensitively communicate sex-biased results to the public.

For this 1-day event we will bring together academic and journalism communities and discuss possible strategies for reducing biases and miscommunications."
